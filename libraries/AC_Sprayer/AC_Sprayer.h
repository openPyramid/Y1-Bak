/// @brief	Crop sprayer library

/**
    The crop spraying functionality can be enabled in ArduCopter by doing the following:
        - set CH7_OPT or CH8_OPT parameter to 15 to allow turning the sprayer on/off from one of these channels
        - set RC10_FUNCTION to 22 to enable the servo output controlling the pump speed on servo-out 10
        - set RC11_FUNCTION to 23 to enable the servo output controlling the spinner on servo-out 11
        - ensure the RC10_MIN, RC10_MAX, RC11_MIN, RC11_MAX accurately hold the min and maximum servo values you could possibly output to the pump and spinner
        - set the SPRAY_SPINNER to the pwm value the spinner should spin at when on
        - set the SPRAY_PUMP_RATE to the value the pump servo should move to when the vehicle is travelling 1m/s expressed as a percentage (i.e. 0 ~ 100) of the full servo range.  I.e. 0 = the pump will not operate, 100 = maximum speed at 1m/s.  50 = 1/2 speed at 1m/s, full speed at 2m/s
        - set the SPRAY_PUMP_MIN to the minimum value that the pump servo should move to while engaged expressed as a percentage (i.e. 0 ~ 100) of the full servo range
        - set the SPRAY_SPEED_MIN to the minimum speed (in cm/s) the vehicle should be moving at before the pump and sprayer are turned on.  0 will mean the pump and spinner will always be on when the system is enabled with ch7/ch8 switch
